# Virtual Department MVP – Product Requirement Document (PRD)

## 1. Purpose / Overview

Build an MVP of a **self‑hosted, multi‑agent “virtual department” platform** that can be quickly configured for multiple functional domains—Marketing, Product, DevOps, Curriculum, or any future workflow. The MVP delivers the core orchestration, governance, and billing foundation so that new domain templates can be plugged in without refactoring the platform.

## 2. Problem Statement

Start‑ups and lean teams need senior‑level output across many specialties but cannot afford full‑time staff in each domain. Existing AI copilots operate as single agents with limited reliability, governance, and cost controls. A layered agent hierarchy equipped with built‑in QA, observability, and pricing solves this gap and enables predictable, high‑quality deliverables with minimal human oversight.

## 3. Goals & Success Metrics

* **Time‑to‑Artifact**: ≤ 5 min from project kickoff to first draft artifact (e.g., marketing email, post‑mortem report, code refactor).
* **Cost Efficiency**: ≤ 25 agent‑hours per medium‑complexity project (≥ 70 % cheaper than hiring freelancers).
* **Quality Gate Pass Rate**: ≥ 90 % of tasks pass internal rubric without human override on first attempt.
* **Pilot NPS**: ≥ 45 after first month of use by 3 pilot customers.

## 4. Personas & Target Users

* **C‑level executive** (you): sets strategy and budgets, monitors ROI.
* **Department Head** (Marketing Lead, DevOps Manager, etc.): submits projects, reviews agent output.
* **Ops Engineer / SRE**: integrates the platform with existing infrastructure and monitors spend & reliability.

## 5. Key Use Cases / User Stories

1. *As a Marketing Lead*, I can request a launch email sequence and receive polished copy with subject‑line tests and CTAs.
2. *As a DevOps Manager*, I can submit an incident log and receive a clear post‑mortem report following our template.
3. *As a C‑level*, I can see real‑time token spend against budget and purchase top‑ups when needed.
4. *As an Ops Engineer*, I can audit any artifact’s generation chain, including prompts, responses, and cost data.
5. *As any user*, I receive Slack notifications when tasks are blocked or artifacts are ready.

## 6. Scope

### 6.1 In‑Scope (MVP)

* Four‑layer agent orchestration framework (C‑Level → Head → Taskmaster → Sub‑sub).
* Modular template & rubric engine that loads domain‑specific prompt packs at runtime.
* Memory/storage: Redis cache, Azure Postgres (JSONB + pgvector), GCS/S3 artifact bucket.
* Pricing engine translating tokens → agent‑hours with subscription + overage logic.
* Secure multitenancy, PII tagging, CMEK encryption.
* Slack‑bot alerts & minimal React admin console (read‑only for MVP).
* CI/CD via GitHub Actions, IaC via Terraform.

### 6.2 Out‑of‑Scope (MVP)

* Full graphical UI for project creation/editing (CLI or API only for MVP).
* Advanced billing integrations (Stripe) – manual invoice acceptable.
* Large collection of domain templates (ship 2–3 sample packs only).

## 7. Functional Requirements

FR‑1 System shall accept a project JSON payload and enqueue it for C‑Level processing.
FR‑2 Each agent layer shall evaluate its rubric and either approve, revise, or escalate output.
FR‑3 Token usage shall be recorded per agent call and aggregated per project.
FR‑4 When budget\_remaining\_hours ≤ 0, new tasks shall be paused and a Slack alert sent.
FR‑5 Artifacts shall be stored in GCS/S3 with metadata linking to version‑controlled prompts and responses.
FR‑6 Admin console shall display active queues, budgets, and latest artifacts.
FR‑7 Audit endpoint shall return the full chain of prompts/responses for any artifact.

## 8. Non‑Functional Requirements

NFR‑1 **Performance**: p95 agent call latency ≤ 15 s (depends on LLM provider).
NFR‑2 **Reliability**: 99.5 % uptime for API and queue workers.
NFR‑3 **Security**: Data encrypted in transit and at rest (TLS 1.2+, CMEK). Row‑level tenant isolation.
NFR‑4 **Observability**: Metrics for token burn, latency, retry count, budget drift exposed via Prometheus.
NFR‑5 **Scalability**: Must handle 10 concurrent projects without performance degradation.
NFR‑6 **Compliance**: Follow OpenAI policy and internal governance for prompt logging and PII handling.

## 9. Assumptions

* Single developer (you) will build with LLM assistance.
* Azure is primary cloud; abstractions allow future multi‑cloud.
* GPT‑4o remains default model during MVP.

## 10. Constraints / Technical Considerations

* Budget cap of \$300 / month during MVP.
* No dedicated SRE; alarms must be self‑healing or low‑maintenance.
* Open‑source licenses for third‑party libraries must be permissive (MIT, Apache 2.0).

## 11. Dependencies

* Azure subscription with quota for OpenAI, Postgres, Storage.
* Slack workspace and bot token.
* GitHub repository with CI/CD secrets configured.

## 12. Acceptance Criteria

1. End‑to‑end demo produces at least two sample artifacts (marketing email sequence, DevOps post‑mortem) passing QA rubric ≥ 90 % of the time.
2. Admin console shows live project status and spend.
3. Slack alert triggers when budget depleted or task blocked.
4. Audit endpoint returns complete prompt/response chain within 1 s.

## 13. Risks & Mitigations

* **Prompt drift**: Implement prompt‑version pinning and regression tests.
* **Cost overrun**: Hard budget caps and alerting; cheap mock LLM for dev stage.
* **Model updates breaking output**: Wrap calls in compatibility adapter; lock model version.
* **Single‑developer bus factor**: Document setup scripts, CI/CD, and architecture from day one.

## 14. Milestones / Release Plan

* **M1** – Bootstrap Foundations complete (Step 1).
* **M2** – Core Loop & Memory integrated; synthetic demo tasks pass QA.
* **M3** – Pricing & Security layers; cost guardrails functional.
* **M4** – Admin console & Slack‑bot operational.
* **M5** – Pilot ready: three real workflows executed; collect NPS.

## 15. Open Questions

* Should SOC 2 controls be prioritized earlier for enterprise pilots?
* Which LLM fallback strategy (Azure vs. public OpenAI) best balances cost and latency?
* Do we need versioned dataset snapshots for audit beyond artifact storage?
