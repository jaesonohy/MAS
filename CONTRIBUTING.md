# Contributing to MAS

Thank you for taking the time to contribute!

## Branching Strategy
- Work on feature branches created from `main`.
- Use descriptive branch names such as `feature/short-description` or `bugfix/issue-id`.
- Submit a pull request to merge changes back into `main`.

## Commit Message Style
- Start the message with a short summary in the imperative mood.
- Keep the summary under 72 characters.
- Separate the summary from the body with a blank line.
- Include additional context in the body when necessary.
- Reference related issues or pull requests when applicable.
